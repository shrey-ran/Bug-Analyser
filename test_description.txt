When I open the Settings page and click the Save button after updating my display name, the entire app crashes and I see a blank white screen.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Log in as any user
2. Go to Settings → Profile
3. Change the Display Name field
4. Click the Save button
5. Observe the app crash with white screen

Expected: Profile should save and show success message
Actual: App crashes and shows white screen
